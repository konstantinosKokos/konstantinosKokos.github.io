            <div class="abstract"><p><p>This paper describes SPINDLE, an open source Python module, providing an efficient and accurate parser for written Dutch that transforms raw text input to programs for meaning composition expressed as λ terms. The parser integrates a number of breakthrough advances made in recent years. Its output consists of hi-res derivations of a multimodal type-logical grammar, capturing two orthogonal axes of syntax, namely deep function-argument structures and dependency relations. These are produced by three interdependent systems: a static type-checker asserting the well-formedness of grammatical analyses, a state-of-the-art, structurally-aware supertagger based on heterogeneous graph convolutions, and a massively parallel proof search component based on Sinkhorn iterations. Packed in the software are also handy utilities and extras for proof visualization and inference, intended to facilitate end-user utilization.</p></p></div>

            <div class="abstract"><p><p>Extended Lambek calculi enlarge the type language with adjoint pairs of unary modalities. In previous work, modalities have been used as licensors for controlled forms of restructuring, reordering and copying. Here, we study a complementary use of the modalities as dependency features coding for grammatical roles. The result is a multidimensional type logic simultaneously inducing dependency and function argument structure on the linguistic material. We discuss the new perspective on constituent structure suggested by the dependency-enhanced type logic, and we experimentally evaluate how well a neural language model like BERT can deal with the subtle interplay between logical and structural reasoning that this type logic gives rise to.</p></p></div>

            <div class="abstract"><p><p>The syntactic categories of categorial grammar formalisms are structured units made of smaller, indivisible primitives, bound together by the underlying grammar’s category formation rules. In the trending approach of constructive supertagging, neural models are increasingly made aware of the internal category structure, which in turn enables them to more reliably predict rare and out-of-vocabulary categories, with significant implications for grammars previously deemed too complex to find practical use. In this work, we revisit constructive supertagging from a graph-theoretic perspective, and propose a framework based on heterogeneous dynamic graph convolutions aimed at exploiting the distinctive structure of a supertagger’s output space. We test our approach on a number of categorial grammar datasets spanning different languages and grammar formalisms, achieving substantial improvements over previous state of the art scores.</p></p></div>

We devise a test suite based on a mildly context-sensitive formalism, from which we derive grammars that capture the linguistic phenomena of control verb nesting and verb raising. The grammars, paired with a small lexicon, provide us with a large collection of naturalistic utterances, annotated with verb-subject pairings, that serve as the evaluation test bed for an attention-based span selection probe. Our results, backed by extensive analysis, suggest that the models investigated fail in the implicit acquisition of the dependencies examined.</p></p></div>

            <div class="abstract"><p><p>We present a framework for deriving inference relations between Dutch sentence pairs. The proposed framework relies on logic-based reasoning to produce inspectable proofs leading up to inference labels; its judgements are therefore transparent and formally verifiable. At its core, the system is powered by two λ-calculi, used as syntactic and semantic theories, respectively. Sentences are first converted to syntactic proofs and terms of the linear λ-calculus using a choice of two parsers: an Alpino-based pipeline, or Neural Proof Nets. The syntactic terms are then converted to semantic terms of the simply typed λ-calculus, via a set of hand designed type- and term-level transformations. Pairs of semantic terms are then fed to an automated theorem prover for natural logic which reasons with them while using the lexical relations found in the Open Dutch WordNet. We evaluate the reasoning pipeline on the recently created Dutch natural language inference dataset, and achieve promising results, remaining only within a 1.1–3.2% performance margin to strong neural baselines. To the best of our knowledge, the reasoning pipeline is the first logic-based system for Dutch.</p></p></div>

            <div class="abstract"><p><p>Bidirectional masked Transformers have become the core theme in the current NLP landscape. Despite their impressive benchmarks, a recurring theme in recent research has been to question such models’ capacity for syntactic generalization. In this work, we seek to address this question by adding a supervised, token-level supertagging objective to standard unsupervised pretraining, enabling the explicit incorporation of syntactic biases into the network’s training dynamics. Our approach is straightforward to implement, induces a marginal computational overhead and is general enough to adapt to a variety of settings. We apply our methodology on Lassy Large, an automatically annotated corpus of written Dutch. Our experiments suggest that our syntax-aware model performs on par with established baselines, despite Lassy Large being one order of magnitude smaller than commonly used corpora.</p></p></div>

Among the proof calculi of linear logic, proof nets are of particular interest, offering an attractive geometric representation of derivations that is unburdened by the bureaucratic complications of conventional prooftheoretic formats. Building on recent advances in set-theoretic learning, we propose a neural variant of proof nets based on Sinkhorn networks, which allows us to translate parsing as the problem of extracting syntactic primitives and permuting them into alignment. Our methodology induces a batch-efficient, end-to-end differentiable architecture that actualizes a formally grounded yet highly efficient neuro-symbolic parser. We test our approach on ÆThel, a dataset of type-logical derivations for written Dutch, where it manages to correctly transcribe raw text sentences into proofs and terms of the linear λ-calculus with an accuracy of as high as 70%.</p></p></div>

First, it contains a lexicon of supertags for about 900 000 words in context. The supertags correspond to types of the simply typed linear lambda-calculus, enhanced with dependency decorations that capture grammatical roles supplementary to function-argument structures. On the basis of these types, ÆTHEL further provides 72192 validated derivations, presented in four formats: natural-deduction and sequent-style proofs, linear logic proofnets and the associated programs (lambda terms) for meaning composition. ÆTHEL’s types and derivations are obtained by means of an extraction algorithm applied to the syntactic analyses of LASSY Small, the gold standard corpus of written Dutch. We discuss the extraction algorithm and show how `virtual elements’ in the original LASSY annotation of unbounded dependencies and coordination phenomena give rise to higher-order types. We suggest some example usecases highlighting the benefits of a type-driven approach at the syntax semantics interface. The following resources are open-sourced with {ÆTHEL: the lexical mappings between words and types, a subset of the dataset consisting of 7924 semantic parses, and the Python code that implements the extraction algorithm.</p></p></div>

It requires no predefined type lexicon, instead utilizing the type syntax to construct types inductively, enabling the use of a richer and more precise typing environment. The type annotations produced are used by the second component, a computationally efficient hybrid system that emulates the inference process of the type logic, iteratively producing a bottom-up reconstruction of the input’s derivation-proof and the associated program for compositional meaning assembly. Initial experiments yield promising results for each of the components.</p></p></div>

This lifts the closed world assumption commonly made by lexicalized grammar supertaggers, greatly enhancing its generalization potential.
