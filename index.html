<p>
Greetings!

<p>
  I am Kokos [he/him]. I enjoy (occasionally) thinking, reading, and talking about stuff at the intersection of <b>mathematical logic</b>, <b>linguistics</b>, and <b>machine learning</b>. This website tracks and presents (some of) my work.

<h3>Whereabouts / Short CV</h3>
<p>
  For the last two years, I was employed as a post-doctoral researcher at Aalto University, where I was doing neurosymbolic machine learning.
  From September 2024 onwards, I spent a few months in Bologna as a visiting researcher.
<p>
  Before moving to Helsinki, I was located in Utrecht. I received my PhD (CompLing) and my master's degree (AI) from Utrecht University.
  Before all that, I received a diploma in Electrical & Computer Engineering from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.

<p>
  A longer version of the above can be found at my <a href="./cv.pdf">CV</a>.

<h3>Research</h3>
<p>
  My published research revolves around structured representation learning, neurosymbolic reasoning, and type-driven approaches to syntactic parsing and semantic compositionality.
  I am especially interested in the interface between formal and data-driven methods;
  if that floats your <s>boat</s> rubber duck, you can have a look at my <a href="./publications.html">publications page</a>.

<p>
  My latest output is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12406"><em>"Nominal Class Assignment in Swahili: A Computational Account</em>"</a> (<span class="venue">CliC-it-2024</span>, <span class="date">October 2024</span>).

<h3>Thesis</h3>
<p>
  My dissertation is titled "<b><i>Dependency as Modality, Parsing as Permutation: A Neurosymbolic Perspective on Categorial Grammars</i></b>". 
  It advocates for the use of modalities as dependency annotations in type-logical grammars, 
  and explores the parsing-as-deduction paradigm from a contemporary neurosymbolic perspective.

<p>
  People thought it was good: it is one of the two recipients of the 2024 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._W._Beth_Dissertation_Prize">E. W. Beth Dissertation Prize</a>.
  You can find a faithful copy of the physical print <a href="thesis.pdf">here</a>.
  If (for whatever reason) you're interested in an actual physical copy, feel free to send me a message.
